# MyPersonnel App

## About

Use this application to manage an employee database. You can easily view all employee records, view an individual employee record in greater detail, edit an employee record, or delete an employee record from your browser.

The React frontend queries the backend Express server for the data necessary to render a user's chosen view, and manages UI via React Hooks, Tailwind CSS, and React Icons. The Express server uses the Mongoose ORM to query and manipulate data within the MongoDB database.
